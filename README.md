# AlgorithmsToRemember

   <em>"Algorithm is a word used by programmers when they don't want to explain what they did!"</em>

Proof is a method of establishing truth, the precise meaning depends heavily on the field of study, hence it differs from one system to another. In computer science algorithm is a number of steps or a process put to achieve a specific and precise result.<hr>

There are numbers of steps used to produce functional and efficient algorithms.

-Model the problem: understand exactly why it is needed to solve the problem and what effect it will have on the program.

-Find an algorithm to solve it. Always ask if it is fast enough? How will it impact the memory?

-Find a way to address the problem. 

-Iterate until satisfied.

Most of the Algorithms and exercises I will be posting here could be used as a study guide before an interview or for computer science  exams or may be for fun.
